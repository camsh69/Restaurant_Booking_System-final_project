## The Brief - Restaurant Table Booking Application

You have been tasked to create a booking system for a brand new restaurant.  The restaurant needs a way to book and arrange tables for customers who are booking over the phone. This system is for the staff to use.

## MVP

A user should be able to:

- Allow a customer to book a table at the restaurant for a particular time and date
- Update a booking, for example if the customer wants to change a booking time
- Display a list of bookings for a given date
- Display a list of customers ordered by frequency of visit

## Extensions

- Don't allow double bookings
- Give discounts to frequent customers
- Send an email confirmation
